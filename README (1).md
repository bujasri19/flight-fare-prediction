# **End-To-End Deployment of Flight Price predictions Using Heroku**
 The main agenda of this project is:

1. Perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Airline Dataset.

2. Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Airline to predict their respective Price based on certain features

3. Deploy the Machine learning model via Heroku that can be used to make live predictions of Flight Price.
